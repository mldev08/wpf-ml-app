In this .NET application, the model is trained on data corresponding to a specific configuration. It saves trained models in a .pkl file, which allows you to avoid wasting resources on retraining. In the future, we plan to add a pre-training function and make the ML model universal, allowing it to solve most ML tasks.# wpf-ml-app
